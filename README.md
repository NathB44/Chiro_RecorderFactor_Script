These scripts enable to develop a correction factor's method thanks to simulated data (see file "EtudeDetecteursChiropteres_BESNIER_Nathan_DRET_Laureen.pdf"). We are planning to update it soon when the field data will be analysed.

# Functions
1) First of all, run Fun_for_bats.R
It contains all the functions called in the other scripts

# Simulating data 
2) Run 1_data_generation_environment_influence.R
3) Run 2_data_generation_sensibility_curves.R

# Checking material effect (optionnal) and modelling sensibility curves
4) Optional: run 3_Material_effect.R
5) Run 4_Sensibility_curves.R
Note : we expect that gam's conditions of application would work the real data (coming soon).
6) Run 5_Factor_feasibility.R
